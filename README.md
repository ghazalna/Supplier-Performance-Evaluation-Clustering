# Supplier-Performance-Evaluation-Clustering
This project aims to evaluate and segment supplier performance using real-world inventory data. By analyzing delivery metrics and stock behavior, we apply unsupervised machine learning to group suppliers into meaningful performance categories. This helps supply chain analysts quickly identify high-performing suppliers and those that may pose risks.
